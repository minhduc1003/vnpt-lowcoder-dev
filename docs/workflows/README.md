# ðŸª„ Workflows

The integration of Lowcoder with workflow tools opens up a world of possibilities for app creators, making it truly amazing in its capabilities. These dynamic duos allow developers to build not just single application screens but entire workflows that are interconnected and intelligent. The synergy between Lowcoder and workflow tools empowers app creators to create applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional.

What truly sets this combination apart is the ability to access data from various data sources. With the extensive array of connectors in existing workflow platforms, Lowcoder users can seamlessly integrate with databases, APIs, and other data repositories far beyond the integrated data sources. This means that your applications can pull in real-time information, providing users with up-to-the-minute data, and resulting in a more engaging and informative user experience.

In 11.2023 we offer now the first integration with n8n which also enables Lowcoder Applications to react dynamically to user inputs. They can process and act upon these inputs, making them responsive and adaptable. Decision-making within your workflows becomes more intelligent, as your applications can now evaluate user actions and provide tailored responses.

Imagine a scenario where a user interacts with your application. With Lowcoder and n8n, you can design workflows that not only collect user input but also trigger a sequence of actions based on that input. This could include sending notifications, updating databases, or performing complex calculations. The possibilities are endless, and the power to create intelligent, responsive applications is now at your fingertips.

In 2024 we will integrate Lowcoder with more different workflow platforms, to offer you the extending the capabilities of our platform.
