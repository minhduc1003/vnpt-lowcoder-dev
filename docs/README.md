# Lowcoder overview

## What is Lowcoder?

Lowcoder is an easy-to-use open-source low-code platform to build internal & customer-facing, embeddable apps within minutes.

Traditionally, building an app requires complex frontend and backend interactions with hundreds and thousands of lines of code, not to mention work on packaging, integration, and deployment. Lowcoder significantly reduces the work you need to do to build and publish an app.

In Lowcoder, all you need to do is drag and drop pre-built or self-customized components onto the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) canvas, along with ready-to-connect databases and APIs, Lowcoder helps you build an app quickly and focus on business logic.
