# Custom branding

Lowcoder provides a white-labelling feature that allows you to customize your workspace's **branding**, including logo, favicon, brand name and color. You can easily configure branding to match your company's branding and benefit from consistent experiences with your company's existing internal tools.

## Branding settings

Only **workspace admins** have the permission to customize branding. Navigate to [Lowcoder homepage](https://cloud.lowcoder.dev/), select ⚙️ **Settings** tab \*\*\*\* in \*\*\*\* the left pane and click **Branding**. You can edit the settings on the left and preview the actual effects on the right.

The customizable branding settings are listed as follows:

* Logo: click the **Logo** box to upload your logo, which is shown at the top bar. The file browser will pop up and you can select an image file. Lowcoder supports `.jpg`, `.svg`, and `.png` files.
* Head color: click the palette in the **Head Color** section to select the background color of the top bar. You can also directly type a CSS color into the box.
* Brand name: enter your **Brand Name** in the input box and it will show on the **login page** and as the browser tab title.
* Favicon: click the **Favicon** box to upload your website icon, which is shown in the browser tab.

Click the **Save** button and the settings will immediately take effect.

### Example

The following pictures show what workspace **members** and **end users** will see on the login page, homepage, and application pages after branding is successfully customized (take the brand name "My brand" for example).

Note that workspace **developers** and **admins** still see "Lowcoder" branding on the homepage and application pages.
