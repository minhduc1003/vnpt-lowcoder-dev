# App Interaction

There are two ways to extend the standard components with interaction. If you are fluent in Javascript, you can develop many interaction control by classic javascript with many helper functions. If you are not "the hacker", you will find the existing GUI elements and controls for interaction helpful.

Any interaction starts with "Event handlers", which you will find at almost each component. Based on possible user interactions, you can take events as triggers to realize a wise set of actions. In most of the cases you can combine multiple event triggers by adding Event handlers with different Actions configurations
