# Bulk Editing

Settings & Properties for components can sometimes be repetitive. That means you would like, for example, to change the Background Color for some components. Till Lowcoder Version 2.3.1 you needed to set up this for each Component individually, which means a lot of Clicks.

With Version 2.3.1 we introduce the ability to edit Properties for many selected Components at once.

The "Apply Action" tries to set the Property Value at all selected Components. It depends then on the Component if this Property is supported. If not, the Action for the individual Component is simply ignored. For all other Components, it takes effect immediately.
