# Lowcoder Demonstrator Plugin Sourcecode

## Overview

This repository contains the demonstrator code for a Component Plugin in Lowcoder. It serves as a practical example and a reference for developers looking to build their own Component Plugins within the Lowcoder framework.

This repository is not about to integrate the Plugin like other NPM repositories. However, for the Lowcoder Component Plugin Creator we wanted to publish the Demonstrator Plugin code sources.
